  # to add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # an image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # for details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # to add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. for
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/schyler-regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/schyler-italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: trajan pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/trajanpro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/trajanpro_bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
